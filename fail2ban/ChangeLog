  better (IMHO). There is a lot of new features

- Multithreading. Each jail has its own threads: one for the
  log reading and another for the actions
- Execute several actions
- Split configuration files. They are more readable and easy
  to use
- failregex uses group (<host>) now. This feature was already
  present in the Debian package

  addition to the path search list: now it is added first.

  come from the local network.
- Robust startup: if iptables module does not get fully
  initialized after startup of fail2ban, fail2ban will do
  "maxreinit" attempts to initialize its own firewall. It
  will sleep between attempts for "polltime" number of
  seconds (closes Debian: #334272). Thanks to Yaroslav
  Halchenko
- Added "interpolations" in fail2ban.conf. This is provided
  by the ConfigParser module. Old configuration files still
  work. Thanks to Yaroslav Halchenko

  more testing. Please test. Thanks to kojiro from Gentoo
  forum for hosts.deny support

----------

    (closes: #329163, #331695). (Introduced patch was further
    adjusted by upstream author).
  * Added -f command line parameter for [findtime].
  * Added a cleanup of firewall rules on emergency shutdown
    when unknown exception is catched.
  * Fail2ban should not crash now if a wrong file name is
    specified in config.
  * reordered code a bit so that log targets are setup right
    after background and then only loglevel (verbose, debug)
    is processed, so the warning could be seen in the logs
  * Added a keyword <section> in parsing of the subject and
    the body of an email sent out by fail2ban (closes:
    #330311)

ver. 0.5.4 (2005/09/13) - beta
----------
- Fixed bug #1286222.

    to any SYSLOG target and facility as directed by the 
    config

    lifetime of caught "failed" log entries
