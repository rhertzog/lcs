Description: bans IPs that cause multiple authentication errors
 Monitors log files (e.g. /var/log/auth.log,
 /var/log/apache/access.log) and temporarily or persistently bans
 failure-prone addresses by updating existing firewall rules. The
 software was completely rewritten at version 0.7.0 and now allows
 easy specification of different actions to be taken such as to ban an
 IP using iptables or hostsdeny rules, or simply to send a
 notification email. Currently, by default, supports ssh/apache/vsftpd
 but configuration can be easily extended for monitoring any other ASCII
 file. All filters and actions are given in the config files, thus
 fail2ban can be adopted to be used with a variety of files and
 firewalls.
