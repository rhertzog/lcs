fail2ban (0.7.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  fail2ban 0.7 is a complete rewrite of the 0.6 version, and if you
  customized any of provided configuration or startup files
  (/etc/default/fail2ban, /etc/fail2ban.conf, /etc/init.d/fail2ban),
  please read further. The configuration scheme has changed upstream:
  0.7 ignores /etc/fail2ban.conf and instead uses a split configuration
  under /etc/fail2ban/. To retain your customizations, for example to
  monitor anything other than sshd, you will need to set them under that
  new directory; use *.local files for customizations. Please see
  /usr/share/doc/fail2ban/README.Debian.gz and
  http://fail2ban.sourceforge.net for further description of new
  configuration scheme. Detailed documentation is under development (see
  #400416).  When you are satisfied with the new settings, please delete
  /etc/fail2ban.conf to avoid confusion.

  Fail2ban 0.7 uses client/server architecture and fail2ban-client is to
  substitute fail2ban command to provide an interface between the user and
  fail2ban-server. That is why some command line parameters present in
  fail2ban 0.6 are invalid in fail2ban-client. Such change affects
  /etc/default/fail2ban; you should review that file if you customized it.
  Please enable sections as directed in README.Debian.gz mentioned above.
  You must use newly shipped init.d/fail2ban, or otherwise fail2ban will
  not start.

  This note was rewritten in release 0.7.5-2 to clarify its meaning.

fail2ban (0.6.0-4) unstable; urgency=low

  In this version the new section ApacheAttacks was introduced to ban IPs
  which are found to run some known attack on the host. For now it captures
  just awstats and mambo related attacks. To make this feature work, the bug of
  wrongly specified timeregexp for Apache's access.log file was fixed.
  Besides that group of log files has changed to be adm, and now they are
  readable by the group.
