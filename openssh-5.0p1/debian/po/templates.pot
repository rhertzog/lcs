"This version of OpenSSH has a considerably changed configuration file from "
"the version shipped in Debian 'Potato', which you appear to be upgrading "
"from. This package can now generate a new configuration file (/etc/ssh/sshd."
"config), which will work with the new server version, but will not contain "
"any customisations you made with the old version."
msgstr ""

#. Type: boolean
#. Description
#: ../openssh-server.templates.master:1001
msgid ""
"Please note that this new configuration file will set the value of "
"'PermitRootLogin' to yes (meaning that anyone knowing the root password can "
"ssh directly in as root). It is the opinion of the maintainer that this is "
"the correct default (see README.Debian for more details), but you can always "
"edit sshd_config and set it to no if you wish."

"It is strongly recommended that you let this package generate a new "

"The version of /etc/init.d/ssh that you have installed, is likely to kill "
"all running sshd instances.  If you are doing this upgrade via an ssh "

"There is an old /etc/ssh/ssh_host_key, which is IDEA encrypted. OpenSSH can "

msgstr ""

#. Type: boolean
#. Description
#: ../openssh-server.templates.master:4001
msgid ""
"Password authentication appears to be disabled in your current OpenSSH "
"server configuration. In order to prevent users from logging in using "
"passwords (perhaps using only public key authentication instead) with recent "
"versions of OpenSSH, you must disable challenge-response authentication, or "
"else ensure that your PAM configuration does not allow Unix password file "
"authentication."
msgstr ""

#. Type: boolean
#. Description
#: ../openssh-server.templates.master:4001
msgid ""
"If you disable challenge-response authentication, then users will not be "
"able to log in using passwords. If you leave it enabled (the default "
"answer), then the 'PasswordAuthentication no' option will have no useful "
"effect unless you also adjust your PAM configuration in /etc/pam.d/ssh."
